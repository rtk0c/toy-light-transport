	// Here is multiplied by 255.99, which I think means "cloest f32 value to 256".
	// Does this make more sense? quick thought, maybe: the point of denormalization is to map the continuous [1,0] number line to discrete [0,255].
	// So we want to divide number line into 256 equal-sized closed-open intervals, with the last one being closed-closed (1.0 maps also to 255).
	// So 255/255-Îµ gets turned into 254.99..., so by round-down conversion gets mapped to 254 rather than 255. But more examination is needed.
